## About The Project

This project helps you understand real-time cloud data pipelines. It does four main things:

1. Collects weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API  
2. Stores data in AWS S3 as JSON files  
3. Loads that data into Snowflake using Snowpipe  
4. Displays temperature and humidity on a web dashboard using Streamlit

---

## Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

##  Getting Started

###  Prerequisites

You’ll need Python installed. Then, install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Also, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys.

---

### Installation

Clone the project to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMIREDDYSHIVANI/weather-pipeline-snowflake.git
cd weather-pipeline-snowflake
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Add your keys to the `.env` file:

```
OWM_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_key
...
```

---

## Usage

To collect and upload data:

```bash
python main.py
```

To see the weather dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

You’ll see live charts showing temperature, humidity, and more.
